- **Field of Interest:**  Electrical Engineering and Environmental Studies

### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - List your current skills and areas of expertise.

    • Vistual artistry
    • Writing


    - Identify skills you need to develop or improve.

   • Coding in JavaScript, and eventually other useful coding languages.
   • Painting and Sketching techniques.
   • Writing skills.
   • Mathematical and Physics Problem Solving Skills.

2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - Describe your key interests related to your career.

    • Learning about global and local waste management, the impact it has on environmental health and how technology is used to combat its effects and improve that management.
    • Electrical engineering ( mostly related to the designing of renewable energy sources such as solar power and automated systems that are used for waste collection, distribution and clean-ups, i.e the System002 built by The Ocean CleanUp organisation )
    • Robotics and how they are built to service environmental health and sustainability.

    - What values are important to you in a work environment?

    • Communication
    • Compassion and Kindness
    • Respect
    • Collaboration or a Community over Individualism mindset ( we grow together)
    • Integrity

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - List the industries or roles you have researched.

    • Natural environment industry
    • Technology industry
    • Art industry

    - Note any particular areas that piqued your interest.

    robots and how they are designed to serve in many different industries, for example AI in the agricultural industry for improved and efficient farming, and robots used to monitor things such as energy consumption or pollution levels with air quality sensors.

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - Reflect on how these industries/roles align with your skills, interests, and values.

    I am currently still developing the skills that I need to be a good contributor to industries of the natural environment and technology. The interest that I have in waste management or overall environmental health, electrical and computer systems are interconnected with these industries because that is where those environmental problems are being solved. The two values that I see most reflected in these industries are respect and collaboration, respect for the environment and our role in ensuring that the Earth is cared for and appreciated for how it sustains us, and collaboration in our efforts to sustain it and to remedy the ways that we damage it.

    - Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration.
 
 Researching economical and energy consumption and how it affects environmental health, researching what methods are being implemented and technologies are being built within these industries to combat these environmental issues.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals.

    • Studying electrical engineering or environmental studies at university.
    • Finishing this software development course.

    - Explain the rationale behind each goal.

    • I want to study electrical engineering or environmental science at university so I can recieve a qualification that could hopefully offer opprtunities for me to be a part of the industries I've mentioned. It will also be an opportunity for me to deepen my knowledge of these studies, become exposed to different organisations within those industries and learn from mentors who have experience in those fields. 

    • Finishng this software develpment course has been a lesson in cultivating a good mindset and coming to terms with the ways that I come up short. It has been teaching me the value of not being afraid of a challenge, to lean in to my fears and not avoid the discomfort of uncertainty. It has taught me that it is more rewarding to show up and allow yourself to get things wrong than avoiding the work and clinging to comfort. I want to finish this course because I believe it will be an invaluble lesson in improving my dynamic with failure ( understanding that my failures are gifts and my most crucial teachers, and not there to internalise ). I will have also learned a new skill which I plan to use for personal projects and perhaps even incorporate into the work I plan to do in my future.

2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Outline your long-term career aspirations.

    •  Work for a nonprofit organisation or company that focuses on environmental health and utilising technology in service to that health.

    - Describe how these align with your interests and skills.

    • In 5 years I believe that I will have developed the skills and knowledge to be a good asset to whichever company that I end up working for, and I will be doing work that I am passionate about because it is connected to my love for the environment and my love for technology.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Detail specific actions or steps needed to achieve each short-term goal.

    University Study: Improving grade symbols so that I could qualify to study the courses I want to study at university.

    Software Development Course: Learn to manage my time better and not being afraid to get it wrong and struggle through it. Showing up for the work instead of avoiding it out of fear of experiencing self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy.

    - Include any resources or support required.

    University Study: N/A

    Software Development Course: Materials provided in the LMS, couching, external resources provided by the internet such as articles or online tutorials.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Describe the preparations or groundwork necessary for your long-term aspirations.

    • Studyng the knowledge that I require at university and looking into doing internships that could provide hands-on experience.
    • Practising and cultivating a better mindset to approaching challenges and in believing that I am capable of learning even complex studies.

    - Consider additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed.

    • Learning Robotics
    • Improving coding skills and computer knowledge
    • Volunteer work such as beach clean-ups and community outreach with focus on combatting waste management issues, to get a better understanding of these problems and how they are resolved.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals.
    - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.

    The obstacles and challenges that I will face in reaching my goals, I believe, can only be revealed to me when they present themselves. Honestly, I cannot say that can predict what they will be, even though I know that they will undoubtedly surface. They could be anything from financial constraints, health issues, having periods of bad mental health or habits that I need to unlearn, but the strategies I can say I will use for any challenge or obstacle are: to lean on my support system, to have courage in facing the challenges head on or show up for the work that is required to combat them, to learn to be resourceful, taking care of my body and mind because that is ultimately where your strength comes from to be able to overcome these challenges, to strengthen my weaknesses, and lastly to give myself grace.

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Highlight any opportunities you can leverage for career growth.
    - Include networking, mentorship, or educational opportunities.

    • The opportunity to study at an insitution that offers the courses that I want to study.
    • Doing more courses , such as the this one, that focus on studying computer systems.
    • Volunteering with non-profit organisations that work in the environmental industries to learn from them and get hands-on experience.
